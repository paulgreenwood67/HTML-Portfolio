                                <p>Collins co-founded the band the Nu-Sonics in 1976 in the Glasgow suburb of Bearsden. 
                                The band changed its name to Orange Juice in 1979. 
                                Collins and his friend Alan Horne founded the record label Postcard Records that year to release the band's singles. 
                                The band's debut single, "Falling and Laughing" was issued in February 1980. Although critically acclaimed, the single only sold 2,000 copies.<br><br>
                                After three more singles with Postcard, Orange Juice signed to Polydor Records in October 1981.</p>

                        <p>Orange Juice released their debut album, You Can't Hide Your Love Forever, in March 1982. The band's second album, Rip It Up followed in November 1982. 
                          Their single "Rip It Up", released in early 1983, reached number 8 on the UK Singles Chart and was noted as the first British hit single to feature a bass-line from the Roland TB-303 synthesizer. The song was their only Top 40 single.<br><br>
                        The band's two subsequent albums, Texas Fever and The Orange Juice, were both released in 1984. They failed to find the same success as Rip It Up.
                        Orange Juice disbanded in January 1985, after Polydor grew dissatisfied with the band's lack of success and the band's difficulty finding a new label to sign with.</p>

                          <p>Edwyn released his fist solo album, Hope and Despair,  in 1989 on the Demon label and achieved success as an independent release. Demon also released Collins's next record, Hellbent on Compromise (1990), which was not as successful as its predecessor. Demon and Collins then parted ways and Collins embarked on a lengthy hiatus.<br><br>
                           Collins built his own recording studio in 1994 from which he recorded and produced his third solo album, Gorgeous George. <br><br>The studio in West Hampstead, London, would become the West Heath Yard Studios that Collins would use for his future record label, AED Records.

                    <p>In 1995, Collins released the single "A Girl Like You", which became a 
                                    hit in both the United Kingdom and United States after it was featured in the film Empire Records. It was subsequently used in the movie Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle in 2003. 
                                    <br><br>Collins released his followup to Gorgeous George, I'm Not Following You, in 1997. One of its singles, "The Magic Piper (of Love)", was featured on the soundtrack for Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery that year and was his only other 
                                    Top 40 entry on the UK Singles Chart apart from "A Girl Like You."</p>

                      <p>In a BBC 6 Music radio interview on 18 February 2005, Collins said he felt unwell, but ascribed the nausea and vertigo to food poisoning. Two days later, he was admitted to intensive 
                        care in London's Royal Free Hospital after apparently suffering a major cerebral haemorrhage. After suffering a second haemorrhage he had an operation on 25 February 2005, which was followed 
                        by a lengthy programme of neurological rehabilitation owing to right-sided weakness and difficulty with speech. <br><br>The aphasia he suffered allowed him to repeat only four phrases, over and 
                        over again: <em>"yes", "no", "Grace Maxwell"</em> (his wife's name) and <em>"the possibilities are endless"</em>. <br><br>Edwyns life had been turned upside down and was now fully depended upon his family for all the everyday things. 
                        But eventually, after much rehabilitation, he managed to enter the studio again and, with the help of his wife Grace playing the right hand of his guitar, he started to write music again.<br><br>
                        In 2007 Edwyn released his sixth albums <b>'Home Again' </b> which since been followed by three more albums <b>'Losing Sleep', 'Understated</b> and <b>'Badbea'</b>. He has also embarked on several UK wide tours playing very grateful audiences pleased to see him on stage again! </p>
